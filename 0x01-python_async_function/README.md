## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is a powerful way to write programs that can handle multiple tasks at once without blocking the execution. This project explores how to define and use asynchronous functions in Python, along with practical examples to illustrate their effectiveness.

## Features

- Understanding `async` and `await`
- Implementing asynchronous functions
- Working with asynchronous iterators
- Utilizing asyncio library for concurrent tasks
- Error handling in asynchronous code

## Installation

To run the scripts in this project, you'll need Python 3.7 or higher. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x01-python_async_function.git

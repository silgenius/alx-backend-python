# 0x02-python_async_comprehension

This project is part of the "Higher-level programming" curriculum, focusing on Python's asynchronous programming. It covers the concept of asynchronous list comprehensions and how they can be applied to optimize the performance of certain tasks. Specifically, this project dives into `async` and `await` syntax for concurrent tasks in Python.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will learn how to use asynchronous comprehensions with `async` functions. Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently, making the program more efficient when dealing with I/O-bound tasks, such as network requests, file I/O, or database queries.

The key goals of this project include:
- Understanding asynchronous programming in Python
- Learning how to implement `async` comprehensions
- Improving performance in tasks that involve asynchronous I/O operations

## Tasks

### 0. Async Comprehensions
- Implement an asynchronous list comprehension to fetch data from a given URL using `async` and `await`. This task will give you practical experience in handling asynchronous iterables.

### 1. Async Generator Comprehensions
- Understand how to use asynchronous generator comprehensions, which allow you to iterate over asynchronous generators, yielding results as they become available. This task builds on the knowledge of async comprehensions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+ 
- `asyncio` library (included with Python standard library)
- Familiarity with Python's `async` and `await` syntax

## How to Run

To run the project, simply execute the Python script that contains the async comprehension logic.

```bash
$ python3 script_name.py
